    "text": "Preface\nThis is a template repository that I and my students can use to start projects that will implement the workflow presented in my lab documentation. It also serves as an instruction manual in this workflow, a template article, and a sandbox for me to practice and learn. I encourage students to use the Quarto Guide as their primary reference.\nThe document in this template renders to two1 outputs:\nTo render this document, use the command quarto render in your terminal pointed at the working directory. This will create a website available locally in a _book folder and a PDF of the article stored in that folder.\nTo render your website and push its content to a live website, use the command quarto publish gh-pages. Details of this process are available on the Quarto guide.\nYou can change the article to a different publisher by following the directions at the Quarto Journal Templates GitHub repository."

    "text": "The introduction of your report is not simply an “introduction”, but rather a motivation of why your project matters. What is the cost of not solving this problem? What have been previous attempts to solve this problem? The why is more important than the what. Why is this article worthy of archiving?\nThe introduction to an article is usually three or so paragraphs long. First, state the overall context of the problem, with citations to basic statistics and previous major findings. Then, Discuss the specific context of your research; why have previous methods or research not addressed your specific issue? You also need to have citations here.\nIn the third paragraph, you can introduce the purpose of your research and the new method or data you bring to the issue. This paragraph often begins with a statement similar to “In this paper, we present…”\nAn outline of the article is then usually a good idea, even though the outline might change little from article to article. A Literature Review details prior research in this area, and discusses its strengths and limitations. A Methodology section identifies the data, models, and other elements you use, while a Results section presents the outcomes of your methodology with tables and figures and a comprehensive discussion of their meanings. Discussions, and Conclusions sections may present your interpretations of your findings for future research, policy, etc."

    "text": "2.1 Citations and Bibliographies\nQuarto has a robust method for generating citations. If you follow the setup instructions, then you can easily search your database from inside Rstudio after typing the @ command. Keep your Zotero database up-to-date and correct (and share it with your coauthors!) to minimize the pain you will feel in writing articles.\nNote that there are two ways to make citations. Doing @key will give you a text citation, allowing you to refer to the author mid-sentence.\n\nBen-Akiva and Lerman (1985) is the canonical reference in choice modeling for transportation.\n\nBut if you put the citation in brackets like [@citationkey] you can make parenthetical citations. You can also give page numbers for quotes or specific findings this way.\n\nThe difference in the choice model logsum can be used as a measure of consumer surplus, and therefore accessibility improvement (Ben-Akiva and Lerman 1985, 301).\n\n\n\n\n\nBen-Akiva, Moshe, and Steven R.
