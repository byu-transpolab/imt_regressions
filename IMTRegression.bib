	abstract = {This paper introduces DataFITS (Data Fusion on Intelligent Transportation System), an open-source framework that collects and fuses traffic-related data from various sources, creating a comprehensive dataset. We hypothesize that a heterogeneous data fusion framework can enhance information coverage and quality for traffic models, increasing the efficiency and reliability of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. Our hypothesis was verified through two applications that utilized traffic estimation and incident classification models. DataFITS collected four data types from seven sources over nine months and fused them in a spatiotemporal domain. Traffic estimation models used descriptive statistics and polynomial regression, while incident classification employed the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Wasserstein metric as distance measures. Results indicate that DataFITS significantly increased road coverage by 137\% and improved information quality for up to 40\% of all roads through data fusion. Traffic estimation achieved an {\textbackslash}text R{\textasciicircum}2 score of 0.91 using a polynomial regression model, while incident classification achieved 90\% accuracy on binary tasks (incident or non-incident) and around 80\% on classifying three different types of incidents (accident, congestion, and non-incident).},

	abstract = {This study develops a procedure to rank agencies based on their incident responses using roadway clearance times for crashes. This analysis is not intended to grade agencies but to assist in identifying agencies requiring more training or resources for incident management. Previous NCHRP reports discussed usage of different factors including incident severity, roadway characteristics, number of lanes involved and time of incident separately for estimating the performance. However, it does not tell us how to incorporate all the factors at the same time. Thus, this study aims to account for multiple factors to ensure fair comparisons. This study used 149,174 crashes from Iowa that occurred from 2018 to 2021. A Tobit regression model was used to find the effect of different variables on roadway clearance time. Variables that cannot be controlled directly by agencies such as crash severity, roadway type, weather conditions, lighting conditions, etc., were included in the analysis as it helps to reduce bias in the ranking procedure. Then clearance time of each crash is normalized into a base condition using the regression coefficients. The normalization makes the process more efficient as the effect of uncontrollable factors has already been mitigated. Finally, the agencies were ranked by their average normalized roadway clearance time. This ranking process allows agencies to track their performance of previous crashes, can be used in identifying low performing agencies that could use additional resources and training, and can be used to identify high performing agencies to recognize for their efforts and performance.},

	abstract = {In 2019, the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) funded a research study evaluating the performance measures of UDOT’s expanded Incident Management Team (IMT) program. The number of IMTs patrolling Utah roadways increased from 13 to 25 between 2018 and 2020. Crash data were collected from the Utah Highway Patrol’s Computer Aided Dispatch database and from the UDOT TransSuite database to compare IMT performance measures between the two years and to evaluate the benefits of the expanded IMT program. However, these data were compromised due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study collected data for 2022 using the same methodology as the Phase II study to compare IMT performance measures in 2022 with those of 2018 after traffic volumes had returned to a similar level as those of pre-pandemic levels. There were 283 and 307 incidents for the years of 2018 and 2022, respectively, that were analyzed for IMT performance measures which include response time, roadway clearance time, and incident clearance time. There were 172 and 236 incidents for the years of 2018 and 2022, respectively, that were analyzed for the user impact categories of affected volume, excess travel time, and excess user costs. Results of the statistical analyses conducted on the 2018 and 2022 datasets show that IMTs can respond more quickly to incidents in a larger coverage area with significantly reduced user impacts. The expanded IMT program is also able to respond to more incidents, including those of high severity, while significantly decreasing congestion.},
